In folder 0 you will find jpg's for orientation 0=normal, 1=90 deg, 2=180 deg, 3=270 deg for SEMI_BOARD 0.

All the boards 0,1,..,5 are kept same for now. Use the only wall on one side for referencing orientation.

The origin must be incremented with this (2*SEMI_BRD_DIM , 2*SEMI_BRD_DIM/5) before placing the pieces because the board's top left corner is at that point

Already have made png's for all pieces

json does not have defined rows and columns. they are random

can use CodeJS.txt for refernce code
